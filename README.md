Welcome to my first GitHub respository!

In this repository, I have included programs from my bioinformatics science fair projects (2021 - 2023), as well as some of my submissions to the USA Computing Olympiad problems. Below, I have also added links to my project documentation to see how my code fits into the scope of my research. I hope you enjoy!


2023-2024 Research - Using Single-Cell RNA Sequencing to Predict Cytokine Release Syndrome Severity for CAR T-cell Therapy Patients
- scRNAseqAnalysis_CART.R --> R code that clusters RNA sequencing data together to isolate genes that indicate patients' cytokine release syndrome (CRS) grades


2022-2023 Research - Determining the Effectiveness of Translational Readthrough Inducing Drugs (TRIDs)
- mathBenchmarkPredictor_TRID.m --> MATLAB program that mathematically classifies fluorophore recordings as obstructed or unobstructed (benchmark model)
- randomForestClassifier_TRID.py --> Python code that utilizes machine learning (random forests) to classify fluorophore recordings with an AUROC of 0.92 and accuracy of 87.7%
- effectivenessPlotter_TRID.py --> Python program that accurately generates a TRID effectiveness plot within seconds, a significant improvement over scientists' manual approach that takes several days


2021-2022 Research - Predicting Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Mortalities and Patient Functionality Post-Injury
- MortAndFuncPredictor_TBI --> Python code that fully analyzes 300 patients suffering from TBIs and can predict patient survival and functioning ability with 96.3% accuracy

USA Computing Olympiad (USACO) Submissions:
- convention2USACO.cpp --> C++ solution to the USACO Silver 2018 December contest for problem 2 (Convention II)
- fenceplanUSACO.cpp --> C++ solution to the USACO Silver 2019 US Open contest for problem 3 (Fence Planning)
